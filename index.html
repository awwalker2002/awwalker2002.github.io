										<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
									</header>
									
								<p> The NBA finals are one of the most watched sporting events in the world, with 
								viewership peaking at 16.9 million people during the 2022 NBA finals. As an NBA 
								fan and casual sports bettor, I was interested in seeing what the biggest indicators 
								of success in the NBA playoffs are and see if I could use those indicators to narrow 
								down the list of potential NBA champions for the 2022-2023 season. I collected the advanced 
								statistics for each NBA season from the 2011-2012 season to the 2021-2022 season from 
								Basketball Reference and conducted an analysis on the data to hopefully gain some insight 
								into what makes an NBA champion.</p>

									<p>As a starting point, I was interested in seeing the offensive and defensive ratings of previous championship winners, and whether or not there have been any trends that 
									can be observed over the past 11 seasons. Offensive rating is an estimate of the number of points a team
									scores per 100 possesions, while defensive rating is an estimate of how many points a team
									allows per 100 possesions. To investigate this, I created a line plot that visualizes 
									the offensive and defensive ratings of NBA champions, and as shown in the plot, the offensive 
									rating of NBA champions has been on an upward trend while the defensive rating of NBA champions 
									has been on a downward trend. This is something that we would expect to see, as teams have become more offensive 
									minded over the last few seasons. Keeping the information shown in the plot in mind, we can expect this year's NBA 
									champion to have a defensive rating between approximately 106 and 112 and an offensive rating 
									that is greater than 112.</p>

									<p>In order to get a better idea of what championship teams look like, I decided to do PCA 
									on the data. I then got the weights of the original variables to determine which statistics 
									are the strongest indicators of whether or not a team wins a championship. The original variables 
									with the largest weights included margin of victory, simple rating system, and net rating. I then 
									found the correlation coefficients for each variable with whether or not a team won the championship 
									in order to further determine the most important statistics in predicting success in the playoffs. 
									The variable with the highest correlation with NBA championship victory was margin of victory, closely 
									followed by net rating, simple rating system, and effective field goal percentage. Margin of victory, net rating, 
									and simple rating system are very similar in terms of what they are measuring, so they are strongly linearly 
									correlated. Because of this, I decided to look only at margin of victory and effective field goal percentage 
									instead of all four variables.</p>

										<h2> <strong>Average Margins of Victory and Effective Field Goal
											Percentages</strong></h2>

									<p>As shown in the scatter plots for the 2012 season through the 2022 season, all NBA 
									champions had high average margins of victory and high effective field goal percentages 
									relative to their competition. Using this information, we can determine which teams in 
									the 2023 NBA playoffs fit this criteria to be champions. Out of the teams still left in 
									the playoffs as of early May 2023, it seems as though four out of the eight teams have average
									margins of victory and effective field goal percentages that are high enough for them to have a 
									considerable chance of winning the NBA finals. These teams are the Boston Celtics, the Denver Nuggets, 
									the Golden State Warriors, and the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>

										<h2> <strong>Offensive and Defensive Ratings of 2023 Contenders</strong></h2>

									<p> After determining the four teams who met the criteria of NBA champions in terms of margin of victory 
									and effective field goal percentage, I decided to plot those teamsâ€™ offensive and defensive ratings in an 
									attempt to determine which team has the best chance of winning the championship this year. Interestingly enough, 
									it seems as though for these four teams, offensive and defensive ratings are negatively correlated with one another 
									as the Celtics have the highest offensive rating but lowest defensive rating, while the Warriors have the lowest 
									offensive rating but the highest defensive rating. This plot suggests that all four teams have similar odds of winning, 
									so further analysis will need to be conducted to differentiate between them. </p>
